Introduction
============

Overview
--------

NREWebService is a Python 2/3 compatible library to ease working with the various Web Service APIs
offered by National Rail Enquiries for access to rail industry data. The web services this library
provides access to are:

* The Live Departure Boards Web Service (:doc:`ldbws <ldbws>`)
* The Live Departure Boards Web Service - Staff Version (:doc:`staff <staff>`)
* The Historical Service Performance Web Service (:doc:`hsp <hsp>`)

Accessing the APIs
------------------

These APIs are provided by National Rail Enquiries under varying license terms. In order to access
them you will need the relevant API keys (which are different for each web service). For more
information about the available APIs and how to get access to them, please see the National Rail
Enquiries `Developers Page <http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/100296.aspx>`_.
